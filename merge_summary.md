# Merge Summary

## Overview
This merge implements major architectural improvements focused on component-based design, messaging service integration, and flow processing. The changes establish clearer boundaries between services while improving state management and error handling.

## Key Changes

### Architecture & Design
- Migrated to component-based architecture with clear responsibilities
- Integrated messaging service through state manager
- Improved state management with single source of truth
- Enhanced error handling through standardized ErrorHandler
- Established clear component and service boundaries

### Component System
- Added new component types with specific responsibilities:
  - Display components for UI and messaging
  - Input components for validation and state updates
  - API components for external calls
  - Confirm components for user confirmation flows
- Implemented standard validation and error handling patterns
- Added messaging service integration through state manager
- Improved component state tracking

### Flow Processing
- Created new flow processor for handling message flows
- Implemented channel-specific processors (WhatsApp)
- Added support for SSE-based message streaming
- Improved error recovery and state transitions
- Enhanced validation tracking

### State Management
- Improved Redis cache configuration
- Enhanced atomic state operations
- Added validation tracking
- Implemented bidirectional messaging service relationship
- Improved error context and handling

### Mock Server
- Added SSE support for real-time message updates
- Improved message transformation and forwarding
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Added client connection management
- Improved message broadcasting

### File Changes
- Restructured component directories
- Moved API response handling to dedicated module
- Consolidated messaging formatters
- Added flow processor implementations
- Updated service interfaces

## Affected Areas
- Core API handling
- Component system
- State management
- Flow processing
- Messaging services
- Mock server
- Error handling
- Service architecture

## Testing Notes
- Mock server now supports SSE for real-time updates
- Component validation includes proper error tracking
- State updates maintain atomic operations
- Flow transitions preserve validation state
- Error handling provides proper context

## Migration Notes
- Component implementations need to use new validation patterns
- State updates should use messaging service through state manager
- Error handling should use ErrorHandler with proper context
- Flow processing uses new processor implementations
