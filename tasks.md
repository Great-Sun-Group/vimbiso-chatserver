## CredexBot Simulation Task

### End Goal
Create a simulation script that allows testing of the CredexBot functionality in the development environment, without relying on WhatsApp on a phone. This script should:

1. Simulate sending a "Hi" message to start the conversation.
2. Allow interaction with the bot through text inputs and menu selections.
3. Connect to the dev instance of credex-core for API interactions.
4. Display bot responses, including text messages and interactive elements (like forms and menus).

### Next Step
To continue towards the goal, we need to recreate and resolve the last encountered error:

```
ERROR :   expected 2 arguments got 3
User: Hi
Bot: No response
```

This error suggests that the `CredexBotService` class is expecting a different number of arguments than what we're providing. To resolve this:

1. Review the `CredexBotService` class definition in `app/bot/services.py` to understand its expected input.
2. Modify the `send_message` method in `app/test_scripts/simulate_user.py` to match the expected input of `CredexBotService`.
3. Ensure all necessary environment variables are correctly set.
4. Run the simulation script again and debug any new errors that arise.

By resolving this error, we'll be one step closer to a functioning simulation environment for testing the CredexBot.

## Project Outline: Modifying CredexBotService Class

### 1. Overview of the Current Issue
- The CredexBotService class is logging an error about expecting 2 arguments but receiving 3.
- The class continues to function despite this error, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
- The class's __init__ method signature suggests 3 parameters, but it expects 2 in practice.

### 2. Steps to Modify CredexBotService Class
a. Review and update the __init__ method:
   - Clarify the required and optional parameters.
   - Implement proper argument handling and validation.
   - Raise appropriate exceptions for invalid argument counts or types.

b. Update error handling:
   - Replace error logging with raised exceptions for critical issues.
   - Implement more informative error messages.

c. Refactor the class to handle different instantiation patterns:
   - Consider using *args and **kwargs for flexibility.
   - Implement clear documentation for expected arguments.

### 3. Testing Procedures
a. Update existing test cases:
   - Modify app/test_scripts/test_credex_bot_service.py to cover all possible instantiation patterns.
   - Include both positive and negative test cases.

b. Create new unit tests:
   - Test error handling and exception raising.
   - Verify behavior with various argument combinations.

c. Integration testing:
   - Update and run the BotSimulator to ensure compatibility with changes.

### 4. Potential Impacts on Existing Code
- BotSimulator class may need updates to align with new CredexBotService instantiation requirements.
- Any other parts of the codebase that use CredexBotService will need review and possible updates.
- Existing error handling might need adjustment if it relies on the current error logging behavior.

### 5. Rollout Plan
a. Development:
   - Implement changes in a new branch.
   - Conduct code review with the team.

b. Testing:
   - Run all unit and integration tests.
   - Perform manual testing of the BotSimulator.

c. Documentation:
   - Update any relevant documentation, including inline comments and README files.
   - Create a changelog detailing the modifications and their implications.

d. Deployment:
   - Merge changes to the main branch after approval.
   - Update any deployment scripts or configuration files as needed.

e. Monitoring:
   - Closely monitor the system after deployment for any unexpected behaviors.
   - Be prepared to rollback changes if critical issues arise.

### Next Actions
1. Create a new branch for CredexBotService modifications.
2. Begin with updating the __init__ method in app/bot/services.py.
3. Update the test script in app/test_scripts/test_credex_bot_service.py to cover new scenarios.
4. Run tests and iterate on changes as needed.
