# State Management Analysis

## Task: Analyze Current Implementation

1. Map the flow of state through:
- CredexOfferFlow in offer_flow_v2.py
- Flow base class in flow.py
- FlowHandler in flow_handler.py
- CachedUserState in constants.py

2. Identify State Checks:
- Look for redundant validation in Flow steps
- Check state preservation in CachedUserState
- Review state transitions in FlowHandler
- Note any duplicate checks

3. Track Variable Re-injection:
- Follow JWT token through state updates
- Track profile data preservation
- Monitor account info passing
- Note where data gets copied

4. Document Actual Issues:
- Only note problems found in code
- Include file and line references
- Show the impact in the flow
- Explain why it's a problem

## Important: Focus on Facts

For each issue found:
1. Show where in code
2. Explain what it does now
3. Point out the complexity
4. Demonstrate the impact
