# Service Layer Restructuring

## Completed
1. Created channel-agnostic messaging service structure:
   - Member operations (login, register, upgrade)
   - Account operations (ledger)
   - Credex operations (offer, accept)

2. Updated core components:
   - Added account components
   - Organized by domain (member, account, credex)
   - Removed duplicate components

3. Updated flow registry:
   - Added handler types
   - Organized flows by domain
   - Improved flow state management

4. Removed old handler structure:
   - Deleted whatsapp/handlers/auth
   - Deleted whatsapp/handlers/member
   - Deleted whatsapp/handlers/message

## Remaining Tasks

### Code Cleanup
1. Update imports in:
   - services/whatsapp/bot_service.py (check old handler imports)
   - services/whatsapp/service.py (verify messaging interface)
   - services/whatsapp/auth_handlers.py (may need to move to messaging/member)

### Documentation Updates
1. Review and update:
   - docs/standardization.md (update component examples)
   - docs/flow-framework.md (add handler types section)
   - docs/state-management.md (update flow state structure)

### Testing
1. Verify flows work with new structure:
   - Member flows (registration, upgrade)
   - Account flows (ledger)
   - Credex flows (offer, accept)

### SMS Channel Preparation
1. Create SMS service structure:
   - services/sms/service.py (implement MessagingServiceInterface)
   - services/sms/types.py (SMS-specific message types)

## Architecture Summary

### Current Structure
```
services/
├── messaging/           # Channel-agnostic business logic
│   ├── member/         # Member operations
│   ├── account/        # Account operations
│   └── credex/         # Credex operations
└── whatsapp/          # WhatsApp implementation
    └── service.py     # Channel-specific messaging
```

### Key Points
1. Business logic is now channel-agnostic
2. Components are organized by domain
3. Flow handling uses proper types
4. State management follows standards

### Next Steps
1. Complete code cleanup
2. Update documentation
3. Add test coverage
4. Prepare for SMS channel
