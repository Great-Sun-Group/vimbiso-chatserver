# Architecture Cleanup Project Plan

## Overview

This project aims to align the codebase with the standardization docs by implementing proper state management, flow framework patterns, and component architecture. The focus is on maintaining clear boundaries between UI validation, flow coordination, and business logic.

## Progress Update

1. Completed:
- Removed legacy core/accounts/ implementation
- Confirmed new architecture pattern in services/
- Identified proper validation requirements
- Added proper step_index tracking
- Added component state tracking
- Added validation state tracking
- Added progress tracking
- Added common flow configurations
- Added flow type metadata
- Updated base component with ValidationResult
- Added validation state tracking
- Added attempt tracking
- Removed business logic
- Added common validation helpers
- Verified API integration patterns
- Cleaned up service coordination
- Enhanced error handling
- Added proper state validation
- Added proper flow initialization
- Added progress tracking
- Enhanced error handling
- Added validation state tracking
- Added common action flows

2. Current Architecture:
```
core/api/
  - Pure API functions
  - State validation at boundaries
  - Error handling
  - Standardized API patterns

services/credex/
  - Business logic layer
  - Pure functions
  - Service coordination
  - Clear validation boundaries

services/messaging/credex/
  - Flow coordination
  - UI validation
  - State management
  - Progress tracking
  - Error handling
```
