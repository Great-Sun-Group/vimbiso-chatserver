# VimbisoPay Terminal Simulator Issues and Next Steps

## Current State
We are working on fixing issues in the VimbisoPay Terminal simulator, specifically in the files:
- `/workspaces/credex-bot/app/core/api/tests/VimbisoPay_Terminal.py`
- `/workspaces/credex-bot/app/core/api/api_interactions.py`

## Identified Issues
1. API Connection Problems:
   - Receiving 400 and 502 status codes when trying to connect to the API.
   - The API endpoint might be incorrect or not responding.

2. Error Handling:
   - The script is not gracefully handling API errors, leading to unhandled exceptions.

3. Missing Attribute:
   - AttributeError: 'CredexBotService' object has no attribute 'utils'.

4. Message Handling:
   - The bot is not recognizing user inputs like "I want to use Credex" and "Yes I agree to the terms and conditions".

5. Authentication:
   - There are authentication issues that require updating the environment variables.

## Next Steps
1. After environment refresh:
   - Verify that the new environment variables are set correctly.
   - Re-run the VimbisoPay Terminal simulator to check if the authentication issues are resolved.

2. If authentication is resolved, focus on:
   - Improving error handling in the `refresh_member_info` and `_process_api_response` methods in `api_interactions.py`.
   - Adding the missing 'utils' attribute to the CredexBotService class or removing references to it.
   - Implementing proper message routing and handling for specific user inputs in `VimbisoPay_Terminal.py`.

3. Test the simulator with various inputs to ensure all issues are resolved.

4. If problems persist, we may need to:
   - Debug the API connection issues further.
   - Review and possibly update the CredexBotService implementation.
   - Ensure all necessary dependencies and imports are correctly set up.

Remember to test thoroughly after each change to ensure no new issues are introduced while fixing the existing ones.
